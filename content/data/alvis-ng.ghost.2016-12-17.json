To keep your balance, you must keep moving. — Albert Einstein\n\nI am not a billionaire, I don’t have a mansion, I don’t have a Ferrari, I don’t have a jet… But I’m a very RICH man, a very RICH 30-year-old man, and it’s extremely joyful to be that man.\n\n---\n\n#### When I say I love my 30-year-old-life, I mean…\n\n1. I have a belief; I came to believe in God in the year 2011 and my life never is same again since that day. It’s 2016 and I still holding on to the fact that If HE can transform the old me, I believe I have everything to move forward.\n\n2. I have a laser focus; everything I am doing now is for the change I want to see next second.\n\n3. I am extremely motivated; I wake up at 4.30 am every day to get myself closer to my life vision.\n\n4. I have a lovely family; I recently learned that I can love my family more than money and career. I have a very lovely wife who loves me tirelessly, a mother and sister who always there for me when I need them.\n\n5. I read a lot; A lot more than I have read before the entire past 30 years. 1 book in 2.5 weeks, I just love it! I just completed David and Goliath during my vacation last week, learned a lot of how to leverage what you have to achieve what you want tomorrow. What is better than becoming wiser?\n\n6. I listen a lot too; I recently realize that I learned more from listening than talking. That includes listening from great people around the world. Instead of listening to latest pop, I listen to the podcast every day when I drive to work. Starting from Nothing and TEDTalks are my everyday speakers. I couldn’t be happier listening to them with JBL Flip 3 that solved my problem of not having a modern car audio system.\n\n7. I know how to say “NO”; Unless it is a “Hell yeah! Let’s do it now!”, I would go with a big “NO”.\n\n8. I don't have FANCY clothing anymore; I only wear all dark blue or white tops every day. I am free from what-to-wear-syndrome.\n\n9. I don’t compare anymore; everyone is unique, we come from different background equipped with very different talents and possessions. We never really lack anything, everyone has enough to do what they want to do. So why compare?\n\n10. I don’t care unconstructive feedback; I remember I’ve developed a little mindset hack for myself in 2015 and it goes like this: “We tend to face challenges every day, we can’t avoid that. This applies to the people around us too, we need to expect there will be at least one asshole trying to upset you every day. So when they come, I’ll have my heart and nerves prepared and say “HERE I AM! COME AT ME BRO!”.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nLife in the 30s is full of excitements, it is a chapter where I learn a lot of new things every day. Constantly developing strategies to utilize my 24-hour productively and try to live the best out of it. I am RICH because I no longer focusing on the material-driven lifestyle, but rather on my life experience.\n\nThank you for reading my story.

He ended up in frustration. Unless he is happy to pay extra for single supplement charges (which is basically charges applied to divers who are not in a group) and accommodation for 2 persons (most dive resorts are based on twin sharing, there is dorm accommodation, but that’s rare), it’s a no go for him. In the end, he canceled the trip because he decided that it’s not worth it to go on a trip that costs about 50% more than the usual price for 3 days 2 nights dive trip simply because he’s a lone adventurer.\n\n![](/content/images/2016/12/1-Yd_RcUlEWt2o3pRAUw-v2A.png)\n\n2 months ago he shared this frustration to me in great length during our casual meeting.

After some researches and asking around, we learned that a lot of adventurers are actually facing relatively the same problem when it comes to kickstarting similar adventurous activities. Most adventurous activities require a minimum pax, usually 4 persons, adventure tourists who traveled alone and wanted to spend their precious travel time on an adventure to some of the most beautiful wonders on earth that God has created for us, will either shell out more money than usual or canceled.\nAt the same time, we also found a great length of Reddits where people looking for travel partners to partake in their journeys, but the rate of happening is disappointedly low.

You write, just about anything that hit your mind, ignore the grammar, ignore the profanity, ignore the flow, your promises to yourself got published.

What did I tell myself in the last December? Never mind.\n\nThe fat belly is still around. Check the bank account, well, at least it is not empty, at least withdrawable.

You started to hate the Mondays and struggle on living the weekends.\n\nThe New Year Resolutions, guess it’s long gone by now.\n\nThe NEW YEAR NEW ME, she’s laughing at you.\n\nIt didn’t work out.\n\nI’ve been there, trust me. That feeling, it sucks.\n\n### If it is too far away, don’t even bother to look at it.\n\nSetting far-fetch objectives, they are not going to do good to you. Setting goals that you don’t need, they will break you. Time flies, but the next 365 days is unpredictable. Human fear what they don’t know. Fear is the first factor to run your motivation dry.

Even it is now in December, I never bother to project what’s my 2017 going to look like. I focus on the day, 24-hours. Highlight the actionable, cut down the crap.\n\n### Focus. Just do it…\n\nLaser focus on what you want in life. Articulate it, visualize it, lock it down, and move 1 step every time. Plan for every day, that’s it. Prioritize the most important task within that 24-hours, the task if you do it, it brings you closer to that person you’d want to be.\n\n#### …everyday\nI’ve been doing it for the second year. In 2015, I’ve decided to start an Internet-based business. I started to learn to code, every day. HTML, CSS, and JS. Without a strong programming background, coding JavaScript was challenging. But for that vision, I move bit by bit every day, I’ve committed 3 hours every day 5–6am and 6–8pm for coding. In August 2015, I co-authored a hybrid mobile application with my friend from scratch using AngularJS 1.x and Meteor. I modularized a major backlog (expectations and use cases) to pieces on Trello and strive to check each of them every day before I go to bed. We completed that learning project in 5 months.\n\n### One step at a time.\n\nFast-forward to June 2016, my friend and I wanted to move on to next stage. It was the time, we had a very strong feeling. We decided to make our idea come to life. A community-powered adventure travel platform, web-based application. The old way of doing it, we broke it into pieces. We designed the entire application in Sketch. The entire visual being our vision, the ultimate objective. Moving on, we set a list of product backlog on Trello, break it down, commit and assemble every day. Sometimes things got delayed due to complexities and the level of our knowledge, but we rarely get frustrated, because we sort of hacked into a mindset of those tasks are very small. They are not some Goliaths, we don’t need to be David every day. If I can’t get it done today, I’m sure it is at least 70% done, so it will be alright by tomorrow. That awesome mindset hack, we love it.\n\n>“Whoever wants to reach a distant goal must take small steps.” — Helmut Schmidt\n\nBreaking things down to pieces is extremely important in moving forward. An objective or a new year resolution may be easy to write, but most of the time it can be very heavy when comes to action. If we never make things smaller, we could have ended up in despair finger-pointing at each other. Now this is frustrating. The good thing about modularity is to bring you back to the focal point. To trick your mind that things are manageable and attainable. “Six-pack” is easy to write, but without visualization and a plan for you to move on progressively, the first day of HITT cardio can cripple you to move forward.\n\nYou can skip the New Year Resolution and that’s perfectly fine. In the closing of 2016, perhaps we can ask ourselves a more important question, “Who I want to become?”. Go somewhere quiet, visualize the answer. If that’s truly what you want, lock it down, break things to pieces, and start checking them every single day. Don’t get distracted by what is not helping you to be that person. Most importantly, don’t ever stop, 0.1% is better than none. 1 step forward is better than not moving at all.\n\n…..\n\n…….\n\n……….\n\n*If the way we do things and our project got your attention…*\n\n*Allow me to introduce you to Expade — A community-powered adventure travel platform.
